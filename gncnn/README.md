# GNCnn

GNCnn (*G*lomerulo*N*phritis *C*lassification by *n*eural *n*etwork) is a Python
tool which integrates a pipeline for glomerular detection and classification
into QuPath. The pipeline is designed to classify glomeruli into sclerotic and
non-sclerotic classes, and to further classify non-sclerotic glomeruli into
12 common common glomerulonephritis diagnoses.

The pipeline is based on the [MESCnn](https://github.com/Nicolik/MESCnn) 
pipeline, which was developed for the Oxford classification of glomeruli in
IgA nephropathy. The paper for MESCnn can be found at

## Installation

To install this tool, which is a local Python package, you need to have Python 3.8 or 3.9 installed on your system.
The package is offered in different versions, according to the platform you are using, which are:
- `linux-cpu`: for Linux without GPU support
- `linux-cu111`: for Linux with CUDA 11.1 support
- `cpu`: for Windows without GPU support
- `cu111`: for Windows with CUDA 11.1 support
- `mac`: for macOS with an Intel CPU

Then, you can install the package by running the following command in the terminal, outside this folder:

```bash
pip install ./gncnn/[{version}]
```

## Usage

This tool is thought to be used from a QuPath extension, which will provide a
user-friendly interface to run the pipeline on whole slide images.
