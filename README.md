# GDCnn

GDCnn (*G*lomerular *D*isease *C*lassification by *n*eural *n*etwork) is an
extension which integrates a pipeline for glomerular detection and classification
into QuPath. The pipeline is designed to classify glomeruli into sclerosed and
non-sclerosed classes, and to further classify non-sclerosed glomeruli into
12 other pathologies.

The pipeline is based on the [MESCnn](https://github.com/Nicolik/MESCnn) 
pipeline, which was developed for the Oxford classification of glomeruli in
IgA nephropathy. The paper for MESCnn can be found at

## Dependencies

The extension requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or 3.9 (not higher)
- CUDA-compatible GPU

## Installation
> [!WARNING]
> This extension **is developed for QuPath 0.5.0**, and has not been tested with other versions.
>
> This extension requires a CUDA-compatible GPU, and has been tested only with CUDA 11.1.

**0.** Install Python 3.8 or 3.9 (not higher) on your system.

**1.** Download the `.jar` file for the extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/israelMateos/qupath-extension-gdcnn/releases/latest) page.

**2.** In `install/install.cfg`, define the following variables:

- `qupath_path`: the path to the QuPath installation directory. It should contain the `bin` directory, in which the `QuPath` executable is located.
- `extension_path`: the path to the `.jar` file downloaded in step 1. It should include the file name.
  
**3.** From the `install` directory, run the following command:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This script will copy the extension `.jar` file to the QuPath extensions directory, and will create a new directory for the GDCnn extension in the QuPath extensions directory. The next time you open QuPath, the extension will be available in the menu.

## Usage
The extension adds a new menu item to QuPath, called *GDCnn*. This menu item contains the button *Open GDCnn*.

This button opens a dialog window, where you can select the image/s you want to analyze.
You must also select the classification mode: *Sclerosed vs Non-Sclerosed* or *Sclerosed + 12 classes*.

After selecting the image/s and the classification mode, click:

- *Run Detection* to detect glomeruli in the image/s.
- *Run Classification* to classify "Glomerulus" annotations into the selected classes.
- *Run Detection + Classification* to run both detection and classification.

The glomeruli are automatically annotated in the corresponding images. An example of the annotations is shown below:

![GDCnn Annotations](images/gdcnn_ann.png)

Another button, *View results*, opens a dialog window with the results of the selected image/s.
The results are shown in a table, where each WSI presents:

- The number of glomeruli detected.
- The number of glomeruli for each class.
- The 3 most probable classes for the WSI.

## Building the extension

To build the extension from source, use the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
./gradlew clean shadow
```

The extension `.jar` file will be generated in the `build/libs` directory.

## Bug with Ubuntu

If you are using Ubuntu, you may get `Ubuntu Error 13: Permission denied` when trying to run the extension. As stated in [this issue](https://forum.image.sc/t/could-not-execute-system-command-in-qupath-thanks-to-groovy-script-and-java-processbuilder-class/61629/2?u=oburri), Java's `ProcessBuilder` class is not allowed to run on Ubuntu.

To fix this, QuPath must be [built from source](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html) instead of using the installer. This will allow the extension to run without issues.
