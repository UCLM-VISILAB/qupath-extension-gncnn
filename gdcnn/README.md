# GDCnn

This project is a fork of [MESCnn](https://github.com/Nicolik/MESCnn), which is an end-to-end pipeline for glomerular Oxford classification of 
whole slide images. The paper for MESCnn can be found at

*GDCnn* (*G*lomerular *D*isease *C*lassification by *n*eural *n*etwork) aims
to adapt MESCnn for a different classification than the Oxford one, implementing
a 2-step classification of glomeruli: first, into sclerosed and non-sclerosed classes,
and second, into 12 other pathologies among the non-sclerosed glomeruli.

## Installation

To install this tool, which is a local Python package, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Then, you can install the package by running the following command in the terminal, outside this folder:

```bash
pip install ./gdcnn/
```

## Usage

This tool is thought to be used from a QuPath extension, which will provide a
user-friendly interface to run the pipeline on whole slide images.
